FanService
==========

This is just a simple mod which tries to "simulate" a cooling fan of the shunter.

The original implementation would "cool" the engine, when the shunter is driving forwards. The current implementation of the mod is simulating that the shunter drives at least 30 km/h when the fan is on.
